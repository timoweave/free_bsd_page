# Free BSD front end layout

To speedup the dimension, color, style matchup process, I use two methods:

1. I put freebsd_screenshot.png as a img background with opacity. that img tag is position absolute, so it is almost like a background, but with the control of img.

2. I used a bit javascript package utils to assist developing html and css. That way, the browser update/refresh
cycle a bit easier and faster with npm/gulp/browser_sync.


## Install and Browse

1. npm install
2. gulp
